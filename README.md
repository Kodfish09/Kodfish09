Hello! My name is Kade McCallister, I'm currently studying Cybersecurity at Brigham Young University - Idaho, and I'm happily married! I'm interrested in everything or anything related to Cybersecurity, 
though I'm still new, and I'm ready to learn everything I can. 

I've used programming languages like C#, Python, Javascript, HTML, and CSS. I've also worked on creating several websites, most for fun, but I'm actively building a website right now with my father to sell 
symbolically meaningful ties.
